excerpt: 'This paper introduces ML-CTL, a multi-level contrastive learning framework that enhances cross-lingual transfer in models like mBERT by incorporating both sentence- and word-level alignment using parallel data. It also proposes a novel CZ-NCE loss to address numerical instability during training. The approach achieves strong zero-shot performance on multiple XTREME benchmark tasks, outperforming comparable models.'

## Abstract
Cross-language pre-trained models such as multilingual BERT (mBERT) have achieved significant performance in various cross-lingual downstream NLP tasks. This paper proposes a multi-level contrastive learning (ML-CTL) framework to further improve the cross-lingual ability of pre-trained models. The proposed method uses translated parallel data to encourage the model to generate similar semantic embeddings for different languages. However, unlike the sentence-level alignment used in most previous studies, in this paper, we explicitly integrate the word-level information of each pair of parallel sentences into contrastive learning. Moreover, cross-zero noise contrastive estimation (CZ-NCE) loss is proposed to alleviate the impact of the floating-point error in the training process with a small batch size. The proposed method significantly improves the cross-lingual transfer ability of our basic model (mBERT) and outperforms on multiple zero-shot cross-lingual downstream tasks compared to the same-size models in the Xtreme benchmark.
