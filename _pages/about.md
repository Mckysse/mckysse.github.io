<!-- Hi there! My name is Beiduo Chen. -->


<p>&nbsp;</p>

I'm currently an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) Ph.D. student in The Center for Information and Language Processing [(CIS)](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München [(LMU Munich)](https://www.lmu.de/), supervised by Prof. Dr. [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) who is leading [MaiNLP Lab](https://mainlp.github.io/), and co-supervised by Prof. Dr. [Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/) in Language Technology Laboratory [(LTL)](http://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).


Before that, I received my Master and Bachelor's degree with an outstanding graduate award from University of Science and Technology of China [(USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Dr. [Wu Guo](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/2011/0314/c2615a19383/page.htm), and co-advised by Prof. Dr. [Zhen-Hua Ling](ttp://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhling) at [USTC NLP Group](https://ustcnlp.github.io/).

#### **Research Interests**

My main research interests lie within deep learning for natural language processing, and I am particularly interested in multilingualism and human-centered NLP.

- **Humen-centered NLP :** human-centered evaluation on LLMs ([Chen et al., 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.842/); [Hong and Chen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22848)), explanation-based ([Chen et al., 2025a](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.562/)) and chain-of-thoughts-based ([Chen et al., 2025b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23368)) HLV alignment, human-inspired pre-training ([Chen et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.9/)).

- **Mulgilingualism :** cross-lingual transfer([Ma and Chen et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.345/); [Chen et al., 2022c](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9956721)), cross-lingual post-training ([Chen et al., 2022a](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9747720)), multilingual adaptation([Chen et al., 2022b](https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.223/)), multilingual evaluation on LLMs ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21693)).

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in topics related to NLP and LLM!
