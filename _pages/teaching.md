#### Mentorship

I supervise B.Sc. and M.Sc. theses on topics related to my own research (examiner: Barbara Plank). For more information, please check [this website](https://mainlp.github.io/thesis/). Thesis projects I've supervised so far:

- **Pingjun Hong**: Within-Label Variation in Natural Language Inference: A Linguistic Taxonomy for Explanations and Its Impact on Model Interpretation of Label Decisions (MSc Thesis, Summer 2025). Now Ph.D. student at University of Vienna. Her first academic paper [LiTEx](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.1728/), derived from her Master’s thesis, was accepted to the [EMNLP 2025](https://2025.emnlp.org/) Main Conference and received the **SAC Highlights Award** (top 1% acceptance rate).
