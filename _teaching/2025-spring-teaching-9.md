## Course Description

The course will take place in English and is divided into lectures and exercises. In the lectures, we will discuss different IR paradigms including, e.g., vector space models, probabilistic retrieval and neural IR. The lectures will be accompanied by practical exercises to prepare you for your bi-weekly assignments (bachelor students) and semester projects (master students). 

The assignments are graded (more on this later) and test your knowledge on the topics discussed in the previous two lectures. For the project work, you will work in groups of two on a topic related to IR. Your project will be evaluated on your submitted code, a short report and your presentation (more on this later). During the semester, we will offer coaching sessions where you can get feedback on your project and report.

## Final Evaluation:

Project Proposal

The programming project should be worked on and submitted (GitLab) in groups of three people (master's students only). Assessment will only be carried out on the main branch, meaning you are welcome to work on other branches, but everything to be assessed must ultimately be in the main branch.

Group selection is open until Thursday, May 15, 2025 (11:59 PM) for your own topics or May 21, 2025 (11:59 PM) for predefined topics. Please submit your project proposal as a PDF below. The following information should be included:

Participants (name and student ID number, group size: 3)
Project title
Research questions
Data
Models
Evaluation
Available hardware

It is sufficient for one person per group to submit the project proposal.

GitLab Account
To participate in the programming project, you need a valid GitLab account at IFI (https://gitlab2.cip.ifi.lmu.de). You can request one using your CIP ID on CIPConf. Instructions can be found here: https://www.rz.ifi.lmu.de/infos/gitlab_de.html. If you don't have a CIP account yet, please find more information here: https://www.rz.ifi.lmu.de/infos/cipconf_de.html

Enter your CIP ID along with your student ID number in the feedback form.
