## Course Assessment and Final Grading
As described in the first lecture, there are a few major milestones and prerequisites before submitting your final project paper: 

* 1-page project propose: this should describe your main research question(s), datasets to use, proposed method(s), group members, and a plan of division of labor etc. This is due on Monday, 23.12.2024. There won't be a class meeting that day. 
* project discussion with instructors: this is to get individual feedback for your proposal from the instructors. This is currently scheduled during the lectures on 13/01/2025 and 20/01/205. 
* in-class project presentation: this is to showcase your work to the whole class and get feedback from your peers. WIP is fine. This is currently scheduled during the second-to-last lecture, Monday, 27/01/2025.

The final project paper is due on 17/02/2025. More details to come and will be provided during lectures.
